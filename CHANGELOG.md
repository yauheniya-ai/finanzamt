# Changelog

## Version 0.3.2 (2026-02-25)

UI improvements for receipt management and database selection:
- Database selector: users can now choose a database, and all previously processed receipts are loaded automatically.
- Receipt browsing: receipts are grouped and displayed by year, quarter, and month for easier navigation.
- Revenue vs expense categorization: all receipts are classified and summarized per category, with totals shown for each.
- Editable records: editing receipts in the UI updates the corresponding records directly in the database.

## Version 0.3.1 (2026-02-24)

Added internationalisation infrastructure and German/English language toggle to the web UI header.
- DE/EN toggle: header now has a language switcher — amber track for German, red for English, black thumb; purely React-state-driven (no native input conflict)
- react-i18next: i18n infrastructure wired via `src/i18n.ts` with `de.json` and `en.json` locale files; components use `t("key")` and `i18n.changeLanguage()`
- Header localised: subtitle translates on toggle; install command stays hardcoded in English as `pip install finanzamt` — intentionally not translated
- Copy button: classic two-squares icon next to the install command copies it to clipboard; swaps to a green checkmark for 2s on success

## Version 0.3.0 (2026-02-24)

Full UI for receipt management:
	- Web interface for uploading and extracting receipts
	- Real-time extraction status and results display
	- Drag-and-drop PDF upload with batch support
	- Integrated static assets for responsive layout and branding
	- API endpoints for programmatic access and automation


## Version 0.2.0 (2026-02-23)

Persistent storage layer with content-addressed receipts, counterparty deduplication, and purchase/sale VAT split
- 4-table schema: `receipts`, `receipt_items`, `receipt_content`, `counterparties` — each concern in its own table
- Content-addressed IDs: receipt ID is a SHA-256 hash of OCR text; identical content = automatic duplicate detection with user notification
- Purchase vs sale split: `ReceiptType` distinguishes Eingangsrechnung (Vorsteuer you reclaim) from Ausgangsrechnung (Umsatzsteuer you remit); UStVA liability = output − input
- Counterparty model: replaces flat `vendor` string with structured `Counterparty` (parsed address, Steuernummer, USt-IdNr); deduplication by VAT ID then name
- Auto-save: every successful extraction persists to `~/.finanzamt/finanzamt.db` automatically; JSON output is now opt-in via `--output-dir`
- PDF archive: original PDF copied to `~/.finanzamt/pdfs/<hash>.pdf` for later display alongside extracted data
- Test suite updated: storage, UStVA, agent, CLI, and model tests rewritten for new API; all 250+ tests passing


## Version 0.1.5 (2026-02-22)

Add CLI and tests
- CLI refactor: Introduced a class-based CLI with commands for version reporting, single receipt processing, and batch processing. CLI logic is now testable in-process.
- CLI tests: Added in-process and subprocess tests for CLI functionality, improving coverage and reliability.

## Version 0.1.4 (2026-02-22)

Refactor config and models, unify prompt categories, fix OCR and utils, and update examples for consistent schema alignment
- Config refactor: Replaced scattered `os.getenv` calls with `pydantic-settings.BaseSettings`; all runtime settings are validated, typed, and overridable by `FINANZAMT_` env vars.  
- Unified model config: Promoted key model params (`temperature`, `top_p`, `num_ctx`) to validated fields; `get_model_config()` now returns a frozen `ModelConfig` dataclass.  
- Prompt separation: Moved extraction templates and category definitions (`RECEIPT_CATEGORIES`, `build_extraction_prompt`) to a new `prompts.py` for cleaner separation of config and prompt logic.  
- Schema alignment: Replaced outdated `ItemCategory` enum with `ReceiptCategory` validated against prompt categories; updated field names (`vendor`, `total_amount`, etc.) for full LLM schema alignment.  
- Validation and serialization: Added computed `net_amount`, VAT validation, and rounded `processing_time` in output.  
- Agent improvements: Fixed crashes from attribute misaccess; unified rule-based and LLM extraction paths; added robust retry and timing logic with structured logging.  
- OCR processor fixes: DPI scaling now respects config, closes PDFs safely on errors, and uses lowercase config fields consistently.  
- Utilities overhaul: Corrected date parsing and German amount handling; improved regex safety and amount extraction heuristics.  
- Exception clarity: Custom exception base now auto-appends cause info, producing cleaner tracebacks.  
- Examples updated: Scripts now use new field names, category logic, output options, and proper exit codes for batch and single receipt processing.
